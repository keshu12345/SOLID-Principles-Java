## S-Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

## O-Open Close Principle
The open–closed principle states "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification";
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## L-Liskov substitution principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## I-Interface Segregation Principle
Interface segregation principle states:
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## D-Dependency Inversion Principle
Dependency inversion principle states:
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
